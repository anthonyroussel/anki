# Anki flashcards

This Git repository contains CrowdAnki data for decks aimed at learning Thai consonants, vowels, and tones.

## Decks Included

1. **Thai Consonants Deck**:
   - Learn the fundamental consonants used in the Thai language.

2. **Thai Vowels Deck**
   - Master the various vowel sounds in Thai.

3. **Thai Tones Deck**
   - Explore the distinctive tones used in Thai language.

## Work in Progress

Please note that these decks are currently a work in progress.

I am actively working on improving and expanding the content to offer a more comprehensive learning experience.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

For an immersive learning experience, the repository includes Text-to-Speech audio files generated using Google Cloud TTS.

These MP3 exports allow you to practice and perfect the pronunciation of each consonant, vowel, and tone.
